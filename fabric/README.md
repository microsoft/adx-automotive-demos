# ADX Automotive Demos

Welcome to Azure Data Explorer Automotive demos for Test & Validation Fleets. This project contains sample code for the [Data analytics for automotive test fleets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/industries/automotive/automotive-telemetry-analytics) architecture.

Here you can find two sub-projects:
- [geospatial](geospatial/README.md) is a Node.js project that provides geospatial visualization capabilities.
- [mdf42adx](mdf42adx/README.md) is a python script that prepares ASAM MDF-4 files for import into ADX.

## Using the projects

A easy way to get started is to use Visual Studio Code and WSL.

- Install WSL2 in your Windows computer
- Install Visual Studio Code
- Check out the github repository
- Open Visual Studio Code using the desired directory as argument, for example

``` bash
code geospatial
code mdf42adx
```
